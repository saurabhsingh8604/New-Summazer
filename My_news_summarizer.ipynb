As Russian commanders become increasingly concerned about their operational setbacks, they are probably attempting to strike the sluice gates of dams, in order to flood Ukrainian military crossing points.Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 September 2022 Find out more about the UK government\\'s response: https://t.co/di4bgNrfIF🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/co6ys1K5zTMore details of overnight attacks are emerging from Ukraine.Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, said Russian forces had shelled settlements near the Russian border.In the Kupyan district, five people were injured from shelling, including two children, aged 10 and 17, he said.Sinegubov warned residents against visiting forests due to a large number of mines and unexploded ammunition. “In the past day, the pyrotechnics of the state emergency service defused 578 explosive objects in the region,” he said via his Telegram channel on Saturday.A 45-year-old man was injured from a mine while picking mushrooms in the Chuguyiv district, he said. A similar incident happed to a 24-year-old resident of Izium, he added.Vladimir Putin has taken a more direct position in the strategic planning for the war in Ukraine in recent weeks, according to US officials, reports the New York Times.The Russian president rejected requests from commanders to retreat from the southern city of Kherson and pull back across the Dnieper River, according to the Times.While such a withdrawal would preserve Russian equipment and lives, it would be another public humiliation for Putin after Ukraine successfully reclaimed large portions of territory in the Kharkiv region earlier this month.News of Putin’s more direct strategic involvement comes after the Kremlin began mobilising 300,000 militarily reservists to serve in Ukraine. Kherson is one of four Russian-occupied provinces in Ukraine holding “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation, which began on Friday morning.Two civilians were killed on Friday in the Donetsk region, and three people were injured, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk oblast.“Currently, it is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in Mariupol and Volnovas,” he said via his Telegram channel on Saturday.Russian authorities in the occupied regions of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson have allegedly started handing out draft notices and mobilising men of conscription age who “renounced Ukrainian citizenship and received passports of the Russian federation” according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence.“Servicemen of the Russian occupation forces continue to commit illegal actions against the civilian population and engage in looting,” the ministry’s statement said on Saturday.“According to available information, in Melitopol, the so-called ‘kadyrivtsi’ seized a dealer’s warehouse of agricultural machinery and are trying to sell off the property.”Earlier, we reported on president Volodymyr Zelenskiy telling Ukrainians in occupied territory to hide from Russian mobilisation, avoid conscription letters, and get to Ukraine-held land.Here are the latest photos to come out of Ukraine and elsewhere:Russian forces launched new strikes on Saturday, targeting infrastructure facilities, Zaporizhzhia city’s administrative head, Oleksandr Starukh, said via his Telegram channel.One missile hit an apartment building causing a fire, killing one person and injuring seven others.Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his nightly address on Friday, told Ukrainians in occupied territory – currently Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces – to hide from Russian mobilisation, avoid conscription letters, and get to Ukraine-held territory.However, if they end up in the Russian military, Zelenskiy asked people to save their lives and help liberate Ukraine..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}But if you get into the Russian army, sabotage any activity of the enemy, hinder any Russian operations, provide us with any important information about the occupiers – their bases, headquarters, warehouses with ammunition. And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions.The so-called “referendums” under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops are a “fraud” and won’t be recognised by anyone in the world, said George Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary who led Nato between 1999 and 2003.Speaking with Sky News, Robertson said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It’s a device by Putin to try and pretend that these areas will now be part of the Russian Federation, and that therefore any attack that takes place, aided and abetted by the west, is an attack on Russia as a whole, but that doesn’t work.When asked if there’s a risk continuing to give Ukraine weapons to defend that land, Robertson added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Well, everything is risky and we don’t know how President Putin reacts in any given circumstance, but that means that we have got to remain absolutely solid and resolute like the Ukrainian people.British music stars Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, US basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal and other celebrities will donate personal objects for a campaign launched on Saturday to support healthcare in Ukraine.Agence France-Presse reports that the WHO Foundation, an independent organisation that works to raise funds to support the UN health agency’s work addressing global health crises, launched the Human Kind e-store, where fans can try to win items donated by celebrities.The funds raised would go towards supporting the World Health Organisation’s actions in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, the foundation said, adding that it aimed to raise $53.7m.Russian forces are probably trying to attack dams in Ukraine in order to flood Ukrainian military crossing points amid Russian concerns about battlefield setbacks, UK intelligence says.The Ministry of Defence said in its latest daily briefing that the strikes were “unlikely to have caused significant disruption to Ukrainian operations due to the distance between the damaged dams and the combat areas”.It said Russian forces struck the Pechenihy dam on the Siverskyi Donets River with ballistic missiles or similar weapons on Wednesday and Thursday after striking a dam near Krivyy Rih in central Ukraine the previous week..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Ukrainian forces are advancing further downstream along both rivers.

The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv within a week, replace Zelenskiy’s government with decent people and then leave. Instead they found resistance, which was then fed by arms of all kinds from the west.Angela Giuffrida in Rome has the full story:In the “referendum” in the Donetsk region, the turnout on Friday was 23.6%, Russia’s state news agency Tass cited a local official as saying.More than 20.5% of voters eligible to vote in the Zaporizhzhia region and 15% of those in the Kherson region voted on Friday, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported, citing local electoral officials.“In our view, that’s enough for the first day of voting,” the head of Kherson’s Russian-installed election commission, Marina Zakharova, was quoted as saying.Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, said that in the town of Starobilsk, the population was banned from leaving and people were being forced out of homes to vote in the “referendum”.In the town of Bilovodsk, a company director told employees voting was compulsory and anyone refusing to take part would be fired and their names given to security services, he said.Reuters could not immediately verify reports of coercion.Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a summary of the latest key developments as it approaches 8.40am in Kyiv.The UN has said its investigators have concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, numerous executions, torture and horrific sexual violence. The team of three independent experts had launched initial investigations looking at the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, where they were “struck by the large number of executions in the areas that we visited”, and the frequent “visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head and slit throats”.Long lines of vehicles continued to form at Russia’s border crossings on the second day full day of Vladimir Putin’s military mobilisation. The president’s announcement of the first mobilisation since the second world war has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, with some men waiting more than 24 hours or resorting to using bicycles and scooters to skip the miles-long queue of traffic jams. Traffic into Finland across its south-eastern border with Russia continues to be busy, the Finnish border force said.Finnish ministers on Friday evening announced that the government would prohibit Russian tourists from crossing its borders over the next few days. “The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,” president Sauli Niinistö told state broadcaster Yle.The United States is prepared to impose additional economic costs on Russia in conjunction with American allies if Russia moves forward with Ukraine annexation, the White House said on Friday. Russia has been planning what the US has described as sham referendums in portions of eastern Ukraine in what is seen as a step toward annexing these territories.So-called referendums are under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops, with residents told to vote on proposals for the four Ukrainian regions to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces are due to run until Tuesday and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow.Some residents are ignoring the vote, Andriy Yusov, a Ukrainian defence intelligence official, told CNN. Ukraine’s state security service has claimed the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, held by Russian-backed separatists, planned to allow teenagers aged under 18 to cast their votes.The “referendums” have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, described the “sham referenda” as “a media exercise” by Russia, for whom the outcomes have been “almost certainly already decided”. Nato described the “referendums” as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest” and said they have no legitimacy. G7 leaders said they would never recognise the “sham” referendums in a joint statement.Ukraine said on Friday it had shot down four Iranian-made “kamikaze” drones used by Russia’s armed forces, prompting president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain that Tehran was harming Ukrainian citizens. Ukraine and the US have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied. Zelenskiy had asked his foreign ministry to respond to the use of Iranian equipment, spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said.Russia will continue its communication with the United Nations about a deal to export grain from Ukrainian ports but says concrete results are needed, Tass news agency cited a senior official as saying on Friday. It also cited the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Vershinin, as saying Russia had a positive assessment of the UN’s efforts to resume the export of Russian fertilisers.Ukraine’s armed forces said it has liberated another settlement in the Donetsk region and improved their positions around the eastern town of Bakhmut. The village of Yatskivka in Donetsk region is now in Ukrainian hands, according to Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the operations directorate of the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces.China’s foreign minister has told his Ukrainian counterpart that the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected”. The meeting between Wang Yi and Dmytro Kuleba took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, and was the first since Russia invaded Ukraine. Kuleba said Wang had “reaffirmed China’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.US\\xa0President Joe Biden has said\\xa0Russian referendums aimed at annexing four occupied regions of Ukraine are a sham and that Washington \"will never recognise Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine\".The voting\\xa0on whether Russia should annex these parts of Ukraine into its own territory\\xa0opened on Friday, dramatically raising the stakes of Moscow\\'s seven-month invasion.The votes in the four regions are the latest shock development in a ferocious war that UN investigators said had seen violence —\\xa0like executions and torture — that amounted to war crimes.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the referendums as a \"farce\", while Kyiv\\'s\\xa0allies likewise condemned the vote at the UN General Assembly as an illegitimate precursor to illegal annexation.In a statement, Mr Biden said\\xa0if the region is annexed by Russia, Washington \"will work with our allies and partners to impose additional swift and severe economic costs on Russia\".The White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\\xa0called the referendum a breach of the United Nations charter.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Russia\\'s attack on Ukraine was \"an attack on all smaller countries\".\"It is an assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller country.

Izyum was part of the territory recently recaptured from Russian forces.The Kremlin has denied its forces carried out any large-scale killings in east Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of fabricating evidence.© – AFP 2022To embed this post, copy the code below on your site\\n600px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n400px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n300px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Facebook\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                        Twitter\\n                    \\n\\n\\nAccess to the comments facility has been disabled for this user\\nTheJournal.ie supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

The Group of Seven industrialized nations said Friday they \"strongly condemned\" the vote.The referendums in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions were widely seen as a prelude to Moscow annexing the regions. The voting overseen by authorities installed by Russia, scheduled to run through Tuesday, is almost certain to go the Kremlin\\'s way.Authorities in the Kherson region said residents of a small Moscow-controlled area of the neighbouring Mykolaiv province also will be able to vote, and that small area was \"incorporated\" into Kherson until all of Mykolaiv is taken over by Russian forces.Ukraine and the West said the vote was an illegitimate attempt by Moscow to slice away a large part of the country, stretching from the Russian border to the Crimean Peninsula.A similar referendum took place in Crimea in 2014 before Moscow annexed it, a move that most of the world considered illegal.Election officials were carrying ballots to people\\'s homes and setting up makeshift polling stations near\\xa0apartments in the referendum, taking place over four days, with officials citing safety reasons.\\xa0Russian state TV showed one such election team accompanied by a masked police officer carrying an assault rifle.Ivan Fedorov, the Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region, told The Associated Press that Russians and residents of Crimea were brought into his city to urge people to vote.\"The Russians see an overwhelming reluctance and fear to attend the referendum and are forced to bring people... to create an image and an illusion of the vote,\" he said. \"Groups of collaborators and Russians along with armed soldiers are doing a door-to-door poll, but few people open the doors to them.\"Polls also opened in Russia, where refugees from the occupied regions can cast their votes.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed separatist leader in the Donetsk region, called the referendum \"a historical milestone.\"Lawmaker Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia\\'s State Duma, said in an online statement to the regions: \"If you decide to become part of the Russian Federation, we will support you.\"Thousands attended pro-Kremlin rallies across Russia in support the referendums, news agencies reported. \"Long live the one, great, united Russian people!\" one speaker told the large crowd at a central Moscow rally and concert titled, \"We Don\\'t Abandon Our Own.\"Luhansk Gov. Serhiy\\xa0Haidai accused Russian officials of taking down the names of people who voted against joining Russia. In online posts, Haidai also alleged that Russian officials threatened to kick down the doors of anyone who didn\\'t want to vote.Yevgeny Popov, journalist and representative in Russia\\'s Duma, rejected characterizations that the process would be rigged.\"Of course they are going to vote freely,\" he told CBC News.\"People in Donbas live under the artillery shelling and the repressions and the threats from Ukrainian government for the last eight years and I\\'m sure that they already decided what they want, and I know what they want,\" said Popov.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians in occupied regions to undermine the referendums and to share information about the people conducting \"this farce.\" He also urged Ukrainians to avoid being called up in the Russian mobilization announced Wednesday.\"But if you do end up in the Russian army, then sabotage any enemy activity, interfere with any Russian operations, give us all important information about the occupiers. ... And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions,\" he said in his nightly address.Putin\\'s partial mobilization of reservists could add about 300,000 troops, his defence minister said. Kremlin spokesperson\\xa0Dmitry Peskov dismissed as false media reports of plans to muster up to 1.2 million troops.Across Russia, men hugged their weeping family members before departing as part of the call-up, which has raised fears that a wider draft might follow. Antiwar activists planned more protests Saturday.Other Russian men tried desperately to leave the country, buying up scarce plane tickets and creating traffic jams hours or even days long at some borders. The lines of cars were so long at the border with Kazakhstan that some people abandoned their vehicles and walked — just as some Ukrainians did after Russia invaded their country Feb. 24.Russian authorities sought to calm public fears over the call-up. Lawmakers introduced a bill Friday to suspend or reduce loan payments for those called to duty, and media emphasized that they would be paid the same as professional soldiers and that their civilian jobs would be held for them.The Defence Ministry said many of those working in high tech, communications or finance will be exempt, the Tass news agency reported.Amid the mobilization and referendums, the horrors of the conflict persisted.Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Synyehubov and the region\\'s police chief, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said at least 30 of the 436 bodies exhumed so far in Izium bore signs of torture. Among them were the bodies of 21 Ukrainian soldiers, some found with their hands bound behind their backs, they said.Russian forces occupied Izium for six months before being pushed out of the area by a Ukrainian counteroffensive earlier this month.The exhumations, which began a week ago, are nearing an end, as investigators work on identifying victims and the cause of death. A mobile DNA lab was parked at the edge of the burial site.Experts commissioned by the UN\\xa0Human Rights Council also presented evidence Friday of potential war crimes, including beatings, electric shocks and forced nudity in Russian detention facilities, and expressed grave concerns about killings the team was working to document in Kharkiv and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.With world opinion pushing Moscow deeper into isolation over the war, Russia lashed out against the West. Its U.S. ambassador, Anataly Antonov, said at a Moscow conference Friday about the 1962 Cuban missile crisis that Washington is trying to bring Russia \"to its knees\" and divide it into \"several fiefdoms\" while stripping it of its nuclear weapons and its permanent seat at the UN\\xa0Security Council.In new reports of fighting, Ukraine\\'s presidential office said 10 civilians were killed and 39 others were wounded by Russian shelling in nine Ukrainian regions.Battles continued in the southern Kherson during the vote, it said, while Ukrainian forces meted out 280 attacks on Russian command posts, munitions depots and weapons.Heavy fighting also continued in the Donetsk area, where Russian attacks targeted Toretsk, Sloviansk and several smaller towns. Russian shelling in Nikopol and Marhanets on the western bank of the Dnieper River killed two people and wounded nine in Marhanets.In other developments, Kyiv expelled Iran\\'s ambassador and reduced staff at the Iranian Embassy in response to Tehran\\'s \"supply of weapons to Russia for war on Ukrainian territory,\" said Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.Ukraine reported shooting down an Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone that can be used for surveillance or to carry precision-guided weapons, adding that it destroyed four other Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones.Earlier Friday, Ukrainian officials said Russia had attacked the port city of Odesa with Iranian-made drones, killing one person.With files from CBC\\'s Briar Stewart and ReutersTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

As Russian commanders become increasingly concerned about their operational setbacks, they are probably attempting to strike the sluice gates of dams, in order to flood Ukrainian military crossing points.Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 September 2022 Find out more about the UK government\\'s response: https://t.co/di4bgNrfIF🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/co6ys1K5zTMore details of overnight attacks are emerging from Ukraine.Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, said Russian forces had shelled settlements near the Russian border.In the Kupyan district, five people were injured from shelling, including two children, aged 10 and 17, he said.Sinegubov warned residents against visiting forests due to a large number of mines and unexploded ammunition. “In the past day, the pyrotechnics of the state emergency service defused 578 explosive objects in the region,” he said via his Telegram channel on Saturday.A 45-year-old man was injured from a mine while picking mushrooms in the Chuguyiv district, he said. A similar incident happed to a 24-year-old resident of Izium, he added.Vladimir Putin has taken a more direct position in the strategic planning for the war in Ukraine in recent weeks, according to US officials, reports the New York Times.The Russian president rejected requests from commanders to retreat from the southern city of Kherson and pull back across the Dnieper River, according to the Times.While such a withdrawal would preserve Russian equipment and lives, it would be another public humiliation for Putin after Ukraine successfully reclaimed large portions of territory in the Kharkiv region earlier this month.News of Putin’s more direct strategic involvement comes after the Kremlin began mobilising 300,000 militarily reservists to serve in Ukraine. Kherson is one of four Russian-occupied provinces in Ukraine holding “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation, which began on Friday morning.Two civilians were killed on Friday in the Donetsk region, and three people were injured, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk oblast.“Currently, it is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in Mariupol and Volnovas,” he said via his Telegram channel on Saturday.Russian authorities in the occupied regions of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson have allegedly started handing out draft notices and mobilising men of conscription age who “renounced Ukrainian citizenship and received passports of the Russian federation” according to Ukraine’s ministry of defence.“Servicemen of the Russian occupation forces continue to commit illegal actions against the civilian population and engage in looting,” the ministry’s statement said on Saturday.“According to available information, in Melitopol, the so-called ‘kadyrivtsi’ seized a dealer’s warehouse of agricultural machinery and are trying to sell off the property.”Earlier, we reported on president Volodymyr Zelenskiy telling Ukrainians in occupied territory to hide from Russian mobilisation, avoid conscription letters, and get to Ukraine-held land.Here are the latest photos to come out of Ukraine and elsewhere:Russian forces launched new strikes on Saturday, targeting infrastructure facilities, Zaporizhzhia city’s administrative head, Oleksandr Starukh, said via his Telegram channel.One missile hit an apartment building causing a fire, killing one person and injuring seven others.Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his nightly address on Friday, told Ukrainians in occupied territory – currently Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces – to hide from Russian mobilisation, avoid conscription letters, and get to Ukraine-held territory.However, if they end up in the Russian military, Zelenskiy asked people to save their lives and help liberate Ukraine..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}But if you get into the Russian army, sabotage any activity of the enemy, hinder any Russian operations, provide us with any important information about the occupiers – their bases, headquarters, warehouses with ammunition. And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions.The so-called “referendums” under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops are a “fraud” and won’t be recognised by anyone in the world, said George Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary who led Nato between 1999 and 2003.Speaking with Sky News, Robertson said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}It’s a device by Putin to try and pretend that these areas will now be part of the Russian Federation, and that therefore any attack that takes place, aided and abetted by the west, is an attack on Russia as a whole, but that doesn’t work.When asked if there’s a risk continuing to give Ukraine weapons to defend that land, Robertson added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Well, everything is risky and we don’t know how President Putin reacts in any given circumstance, but that means that we have got to remain absolutely solid and resolute like the Ukrainian people.British music stars Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, US basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal and other celebrities will donate personal objects for a campaign launched on Saturday to support healthcare in Ukraine.Agence France-Presse reports that the WHO Foundation, an independent organisation that works to raise funds to support the UN health agency’s work addressing global health crises, launched the Human Kind e-store, where fans can try to win items donated by celebrities.The funds raised would go towards supporting the World Health Organisation’s actions in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, the foundation said, adding that it aimed to raise $53.7m.Russian forces are probably trying to attack dams in Ukraine in order to flood Ukrainian military crossing points amid Russian concerns about battlefield setbacks, UK intelligence says.The Ministry of Defence said in its latest daily briefing that the strikes were “unlikely to have caused significant disruption to Ukrainian operations due to the distance between the damaged dams and the combat areas”.It said Russian forces struck the Pechenihy dam on the Siverskyi Donets River with ballistic missiles or similar weapons on Wednesday and Thursday after striking a dam near Krivyy Rih in central Ukraine the previous week..css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Ukrainian forces are advancing further downstream along both rivers.

The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv within a week, replace Zelenskiy’s government with decent people and then leave. Instead they found resistance, which was then fed by arms of all kinds from the west.Angela Giuffrida in Rome has the full story:In the “referendum” in the Donetsk region, the turnout on Friday was 23.6%, Russia’s state news agency Tass cited a local official as saying.More than 20.5% of voters eligible to vote in the Zaporizhzhia region and 15% of those in the Kherson region voted on Friday, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported, citing local electoral officials.“In our view, that’s enough for the first day of voting,” the head of Kherson’s Russian-installed election commission, Marina Zakharova, was quoted as saying.Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, said that in the town of Starobilsk, the population was banned from leaving and people were being forced out of homes to vote in the “referendum”.In the town of Bilovodsk, a company director told employees voting was compulsory and anyone refusing to take part would be fired and their names given to security services, he said.Reuters could not immediately verify reports of coercion.Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a summary of the latest key developments as it approaches 8.40am in Kyiv.The UN has said its investigators have concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, numerous executions, torture and horrific sexual violence. The team of three independent experts had launched initial investigations looking at the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, where they were “struck by the large number of executions in the areas that we visited”, and the frequent “visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head and slit throats”.Long lines of vehicles continued to form at Russia’s border crossings on the second day full day of Vladimir Putin’s military mobilisation. The president’s announcement of the first mobilisation since the second world war has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, with some men waiting more than 24 hours or resorting to using bicycles and scooters to skip the miles-long queue of traffic jams. Traffic into Finland across its south-eastern border with Russia continues to be busy, the Finnish border force said.Finnish ministers on Friday evening announced that the government would prohibit Russian tourists from crossing its borders over the next few days. “The aspiration and purpose is to significantly reduce the number of people coming to Finland from Russia,” president Sauli Niinistö told state broadcaster Yle.The United States is prepared to impose additional economic costs on Russia in conjunction with American allies if Russia moves forward with Ukraine annexation, the White House said on Friday. Russia has been planning what the US has described as sham referendums in portions of eastern Ukraine in what is seen as a step toward annexing these territories.So-called referendums are under way in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops, with residents told to vote on proposals for the four Ukrainian regions to declare independence and then join Russia. The polls in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces are due to run until Tuesday and appear to be a thin attempt to provide cover for illegal annexation of the regions by Moscow.Some residents are ignoring the vote, Andriy Yusov, a Ukrainian defence intelligence official, told CNN. Ukraine’s state security service has claimed the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, held by Russian-backed separatists, planned to allow teenagers aged under 18 to cast their votes.The “referendums” have been widely condemned in the west as illegitimate. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, described the “sham referenda” as “a media exercise” by Russia, for whom the outcomes have been “almost certainly already decided”. Nato described the “referendums” as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest” and said they have no legitimacy. G7 leaders said they would never recognise the “sham” referendums in a joint statement.Ukraine said on Friday it had shot down four Iranian-made “kamikaze” drones used by Russia’s armed forces, prompting president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to complain that Tehran was harming Ukrainian citizens. Ukraine and the US have accused Iran of supplying drones to Russia, something Tehran has denied. Zelenskiy had asked his foreign ministry to respond to the use of Iranian equipment, spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said.Russia will continue its communication with the United Nations about a deal to export grain from Ukrainian ports but says concrete results are needed, Tass news agency cited a senior official as saying on Friday. It also cited the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Vershinin, as saying Russia had a positive assessment of the UN’s efforts to resume the export of Russian fertilisers.Ukraine’s armed forces said it has liberated another settlement in the Donetsk region and improved their positions around the eastern town of Bakhmut. The village of Yatskivka in Donetsk region is now in Ukrainian hands, according to Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the operations directorate of the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces.China’s foreign minister has told his Ukrainian counterpart that the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected”. The meeting between Wang Yi and Dmytro Kuleba took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, and was the first since Russia invaded Ukraine. Kuleba said Wang had “reaffirmed China’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.US\\xa0President Joe Biden has said\\xa0Russian referendums aimed at annexing four occupied regions of Ukraine are a sham and that Washington \"will never recognise Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine\".The voting\\xa0on whether Russia should annex these parts of Ukraine into its own territory\\xa0opened on Friday, dramatically raising the stakes of Moscow\\'s seven-month invasion.The votes in the four regions are the latest shock development in a ferocious war that UN investigators said had seen violence —\\xa0like executions and torture — that amounted to war crimes.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the referendums as a \"farce\", while Kyiv\\'s\\xa0allies likewise condemned the vote at the UN General Assembly as an illegitimate precursor to illegal annexation.In a statement, Mr Biden said\\xa0if the region is annexed by Russia, Washington \"will work with our allies and partners to impose additional swift and severe economic costs on Russia\".The White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\\xa0called the referendum a breach of the United Nations charter.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Russia\\'s attack on Ukraine was \"an attack on all smaller countries\".\"It is an assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller country. To decide whether another country can even exist,\" Ms Wong said.\"It was never intended that the security council veto power would be used to enable uncheck abuse of the UN charter.\"Even China, Russia\\'s closest ally since the war began, has acknowledged that the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected\".Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comments to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba at the UN.On Friday, authorities in the Russian-controlled regions began going door-to-door\\xa0to collect votes, according to state media.\"In-person voting will take place exclusively on September 27,\" TASS media reported.\"On the other days, voting will be organised in communities and in a door-to-door manner for security reasons.\"It was also possible to vote at the building in Moscow that represents the Donetsk breakaway region.There are no independent observers, and much of the pre-war population has fled.One local resident in\\xa0Enerhodar told the BBC: \"You have to answer verbally and the soldier marks the answer on the sheet and keeps it.\"Russian-backed officials across 15 per cent of Ukraine\\'s territory have requested referendums to join Russia, in what appears to be choreographed moves by separatist groups.Others described armed soldiers visiting their homes as asking the household to sign a single ballot with their vote.Ballots in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia asked the question: \"Are you in favour of secession from Ukraine, formation of an independent state by the region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?\"Leonid, a 59-year-old military official, told AFP he was \"feeling happy\".\"Ultimately, things are moving towards the restoration of the Soviet Union. The referendum is one step towards this,\" he said.\"Donbas is Russia\" said a post on Telegram by Denis Pushilin, a pro-Russian separatist leader in Donetsk —\\xa0part of the industrial Donbas region.But earlier this month, a Ukrainian counter-offensive seized back most of the north-eastern Kharkiv region, bringing hundreds of settlements back under Kyiv\\'s control after months of Russian occupation.On Friday, Kyiv said its forces had made more progress, recapturing a village in the Donetsk region and retaking positions south of the war-scarred town of Bakhmut.The four regions\\' integration into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict as Moscow would consider any military move there as an attack on its own territory.The referendums are reminiscent of Russia\\'s annexation of Ukraine\\'s Crimea in 2014 and the referendum there, denounced by Western nations, who imposed sanctions on Moscow as a result.UN investigators\\xa0said Friday that war crimes had been committed in the Ukraine conflict, listing Russian bombings of civilian areas, as well as executions, torture and horrific sexual violence.In Russian detention facilities, investigators said they found\\xa0evidence of beatings, electric shocks and forced nudity.Erik Mose, who has led a team of investigators set up in March, said they were \"struck by the large number of executions\".In the eastern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said Friday that they had completed their exhumation of 447 bodies from a mass burial site near the city of Izyum.\"Most of them have signs of violent death, and 30 have signs of torture,\" said Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov in a post on social media.\"There are bodies with rope around their necks, with their hands tied, with broken limbs and gunshot wounds.\"Izyum was part of the territory recently recaptured from Russian forces.The Kremlin has denied its forces carried out any large-scale killings in eastern Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of fabricating evidence.ABC/wiresWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)UN says Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine; Finland bars Russian tourists amid long queues to cross border after Putin’s military mobilisationThe UN has said its investigators have concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine, including bombings of civilian areas, numerous executions, torture and horrific sexual violence.

Polling stations then open on Tuesday for residents to cast ballots on the final day of voting.It was also possible to vote at the building in Moscow that represents the Donetsk breakaway region.Leonid, a 59-year-old military official, told AFP he was “feeling happy”.“Ultimately, things are moving towards the restoration of the Soviet Union. The referendum is one step towards this,” he said.“Donbas is Russia” said a post on Telegram by Denis Pushilin, a pro-Russian separatist leader in Donetsk – part of the industrial Donbas region.But earlier this month, a Ukrainian counter-offensive seized back most of the north-eastern Kharkiv region, bringing hundreds of settlements back under Kyiv’s control after months of Russian occupation.Today, Kyiv said its forces had made more progress, recapturing a village in the Donetsk region and retaking positions south of the war-scarred town of Bakhmut.The four regions’ integration into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict as Moscow would consider any military move there as an attack on its own territory.The referendums are reminiscent of Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and the referendum there, denounced by Western nations, who imposed sanctions on Moscow as a result.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the referendums as a “farce”.Evidence of ‘war crimes’Today, the G7 Group of Seven industrialised nations also condemned the referendums as a “sham” with “no legal effect or legitimacy”.But in Donetsk and Lugansk – which Putin recognised as independent just before invading Ukraine in February – residents are answering if they support their “republic’s entry into Russia”, TASS reported.Ballots in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia ask the question: “Are you in favour of secession from Ukraine, formation of an independent state by the region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?”Russian news agencies reported that voting had begun at 5am today, while TASS reported paper ballots would be used to save time.UN investigators meanwhile said today that war crimes had been committed in the Ukraine conflict, listing Russian bombings of civilian areas, as well as executions, torture and horrific sexual violence.Erik Mose, who has led a team of investigators set up in March, said they were “struck by the large number of executions”.In eastern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said today that they had completed their exhumation of 447 bodies from a mass burial site near the city of Izyum.“Most of them have signs of violent death, and 30 have signs of torture,” said Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov in a post on social media.“There are bodies with rope around their necks, with their hands tied, with broken limbs and gunshot wounds,” he added. Izyum was part of the territory recently recaptured from Russian forces.The Kremlin has denied its forces carried out any large-scale killings in east Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of fabricating evidence.© – AFP 2022To embed this post, copy the code below on your site\\n600px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n400px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n300px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-russia-7-5874090-Sep2022/?embedpost=5874090&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Facebook\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                        Twitter\\n                    \\n\\n\\nAccess to the comments facility has been disabled for this user\\nTheJournal.ie supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

The Group of Seven industrialized nations said Friday they \"strongly condemned\" the vote.The referendums in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions were widely seen as a prelude to Moscow annexing the regions. The voting overseen by authorities installed by Russia, scheduled to run through Tuesday, is almost certain to go the Kremlin\\'s way.Authorities in the Kherson region said residents of a small Moscow-controlled area of the neighbouring Mykolaiv province also will be able to vote, and that small area was \"incorporated\" into Kherson until all of Mykolaiv is taken over by Russian forces.Ukraine and the West said the vote was an illegitimate attempt by Moscow to slice away a large part of the country, stretching from the Russian border to the Crimean Peninsula.A similar referendum took place in Crimea in 2014 before Moscow annexed it, a move that most of the world considered illegal.Election officials were carrying ballots to people\\'s homes and setting up makeshift polling stations near\\xa0apartments in the referendum, taking place over four days, with officials citing safety reasons.\\xa0Russian state TV showed one such election team accompanied by a masked police officer carrying an assault rifle.Ivan Fedorov, the Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region, told The Associated Press that Russians and residents of Crimea were brought into his city to urge people to vote.\"The Russians see an overwhelming reluctance and fear to attend the referendum and are forced to bring people... to create an image and an illusion of the vote,\" he said. \"Groups of collaborators and Russians along with armed soldiers are doing a door-to-door poll, but few people open the doors to them.\"Polls also opened in Russia, where refugees from the occupied regions can cast their votes.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed separatist leader in the Donetsk region, called the referendum \"a historical milestone.\"Lawmaker Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia\\'s State Duma, said in an online statement to the regions: \"If you decide to become part of the Russian Federation, we will support you.\"Thousands attended pro-Kremlin rallies across Russia in support the referendums, news agencies reported. \"Long live the one, great, united Russian people!\" one speaker told the large crowd at a central Moscow rally and concert titled, \"We Don\\'t Abandon Our Own.\"Luhansk Gov. Serhiy\\xa0Haidai accused Russian officials of taking down the names of people who voted against joining Russia. In online posts, Haidai also alleged that Russian officials threatened to kick down the doors of anyone who didn\\'t want to vote.Yevgeny Popov, journalist and representative in Russia\\'s Duma, rejected characterizations that the process would be rigged.\"Of course they are going to vote freely,\" he told CBC News.\"People in Donbas live under the artillery shelling and the repressions and the threats from Ukrainian government for the last eight years and I\\'m sure that they already decided what they want, and I know what they want,\" said Popov.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians in occupied regions to undermine the referendums and to share information about the people conducting \"this farce.\" He also urged Ukrainians to avoid being called up in the Russian mobilization announced Wednesday.\"But if you do end up in the Russian army, then sabotage any enemy activity, interfere with any Russian operations, give us all important information about the occupiers. ... And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions,\" he said in his nightly address.Putin\\'s partial mobilization of reservists could add about 300,000 troops, his defence minister said. Kremlin spokesperson\\xa0Dmitry Peskov dismissed as false media reports of plans to muster up to 1.2 million troops.Across Russia, men hugged their weeping family members before departing as part of the call-up, which has raised fears that a wider draft might follow. Antiwar activists planned more protests Saturday.Other Russian men tried desperately to leave the country, buying up scarce plane tickets and creating traffic jams hours or even days long at some borders. The lines of cars were so long at the border with Kazakhstan that some people abandoned their vehicles and walked — just as some Ukrainians did after Russia invaded their country Feb. 24.Russian authorities sought to calm public fears over the call-up. Lawmakers introduced a bill Friday to suspend or reduce loan payments for those called to duty, and media emphasized that they would be paid the same as professional soldiers and that their civilian jobs would be held for them.The Defence Ministry said many of those working in high tech, communications or finance will be exempt, the Tass news agency reported.Amid the mobilization and referendums, the horrors of the conflict persisted.Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Synyehubov and the region\\'s police chief, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said at least 30 of the 436 bodies exhumed so far in Izium bore signs of torture. Among them were the bodies of 21 Ukrainian soldiers, some found with their hands bound behind their backs, they said.Russian forces occupied Izium for six months before being pushed out of the area by a Ukrainian counteroffensive earlier this month.The exhumations, which began a week ago, are nearing an end, as investigators work on identifying victims and the cause of death. A mobile DNA lab was parked at the edge of the burial site.Experts commissioned by the UN\\xa0Human Rights Council also presented evidence Friday of potential war crimes, including beatings, electric shocks and forced nudity in Russian detention facilities, and expressed grave concerns about killings the team was working to document in Kharkiv and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.With world opinion pushing Moscow deeper into isolation over the war, Russia lashed out against the West. Its U.S. ambassador, Anataly Antonov, said at a Moscow conference Friday about the 1962 Cuban missile crisis that Washington is trying to bring Russia \"to its knees\" and divide it into \"several fiefdoms\" while stripping it of its nuclear weapons and its permanent seat at the UN\\xa0Security Council.In new reports of fighting, Ukraine\\'s presidential office said 10 civilians were killed and 39 others were wounded by Russian shelling in nine Ukrainian regions.Battles continued in the southern Kherson during the vote, it said, while Ukrainian forces meted out 280 attacks on Russian command posts, munitions depots and weapons.Heavy fighting also continued in the Donetsk area, where Russian attacks targeted Toretsk, Sloviansk and several smaller towns. Russian shelling in Nikopol and Marhanets on the western bank of the Dnieper River killed two people and wounded nine in Marhanets.In other developments, Kyiv expelled Iran\\'s ambassador and reduced staff at the Iranian Embassy in response to Tehran\\'s \"supply of weapons to Russia for war on Ukrainian territory,\" said Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.Ukraine reported shooting down an Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone that can be used for surveillance or to carry precision-guided weapons, adding that it destroyed four other Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones.Earlier Friday, Ukrainian officials said Russia had attacked the port city of Odesa with Iranian-made drones, killing one person.With files from CBC\\'s Briar Stewart and ReutersTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada\\'s online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Ukraine initially chased his troops from the Kyiv area, and more recently from the northeast near the Russia border.\\xa0Putin now says the main aim is to secure territory in Ukraine\\'s Donbas region partly controlled by pro-Russia separatists.Speaking on Italian public television RAI, Berlusconi suggested Moscow\\'s decision to invade came in response to an appeal by the separatists.He said their leaders came to the Kremlin and directly told Putin: \"Please defend us, because if you do not defend us, we don\\'t know where we could end up.\"After Russia\\' annexation of Crimea in 2014, Berlusconi said that he visited the peninsula with Putin and saw locals come out and thank the Russian leader.23 SepThe Sport Report - Weekly\\n                    Get the Sport Report every Thursday to stay up to speed with everything you need to know in the world of sport.\\n\\n                4h ago3h ago25 Jun 202117 Sep10 Sep03 Sep23 Sep7h ago23 Sep23 SepContact the public editor with feedback for our journalists, complaints, queries or suggestions about articles on News24.

The Indian prime minister\\'s remarks have been welcomed by the western world including the United States, France and the United Kingdom.ALSO READ | 4 Ukraine regions prepare to hold referendums to join Russia\"Based on its pacifist vocation, Mexico believes that the international community must now channel its best efforts to achieve peace,\" Casaubón said.\"In this regard, I would like to share with you the proposal of the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to strengthen the mediation efforts of UN Secretary-General António Guterres, through the formation of a Committee for Dialogue and Peace in Ukraine with the participation of other heads of state and government, including, if possible, His Excellency Narendra Modi and His Holiness Pope Francis.\"He said the objective of the committee would be to generate new mechanisms for dialogue and create complementary spaces for mediation to build confidence, reduce tensions and open the way for lasting peace.ALSO READ | Protests break out in Russia, over 1k detained as Putin orders partial military call-upCasaubon said the Mexican delegation will continue with the necessary consultations to contribute towards generating broad support for the mediation efforts led by the UN secretary-general as well as for the committee, \"whose formation we hope will proceed with the support of the UN member states that so decide\".\"As the Secretary-General has said, it is time to act and commit to peace. To settle for war is always to go to the precipice,\" he said.The Mexican foreign minister argued that peace can only be achieved through dialogue, diplomacy and by building effective political channels.ALSO READ | India receives military supplies from Moscow amid Russia-Ukraine war\"Indifference is unacceptable, just as it is unacceptable to simply lament the fact that, so far, in the case in question, the Security Council has not been able to fulfil its essential responsibility,\" he said.\"The reasons why this Council can become dysfunctional are well known. It is up to us to correct them. The time is right to consider, in all seriousness, the structural reforms required to do so,\" Casaubon added. Film critics, beware.

Kharkiv region officials said a mass burial site in the eastern city of Izium held hundreds of bodies, including at least 30 displaying signs of torture.
